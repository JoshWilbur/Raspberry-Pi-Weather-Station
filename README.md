# Raspberry-Pi-Weather-Station
Authors: Joshua Wilbur, Amir Seidakhmetov, Henry Willard
This repo will hold the code for a Raspberry Pi 2B weather station. The ST7735_TFT_RPI-1.6 library by Gavin Lyons is used to interface with a 1.8" TFT LCD display over SPI. This library is used for initial setup and basic interfacing of the display.
